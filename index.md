## Welcome to John's Home

My site is under renovation ðŸ‘¾! 

I'm a Software Engineer working at StashAway - Singapore's first digital wealth management platform for everyone. I was working for Goldman Sachs ([@goldmansachs](https://github.com/goldmansachs)) - [Global Investment Research(GIR)](http://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/why-goldman-sachs/our-divisions/global-investment-research/) and mainly focus on equity research applications.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lizhuoran1992/lizhuoran1992.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
